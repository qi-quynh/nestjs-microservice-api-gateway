# Microservice Project with NestJS, Prisma, MySQL, and NATS

This project provides a solid foundation for building a microservices-based application using NestJS, Prisma, MySQL, and NATS. 
It includes multiple microservices like **API Gateway**, **reader-mgt**, and **article-mgt** to manage readers and articles, along with communication using NATS.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **Docker** (for running MySQL container)
- **Postman** (for testing API calls)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qi-quynh/nestjs-microservice-api-gateway.git
cd nestjs-microservice-api-gateway
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies for all microservices:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up MySQL Database with Docker
If you donâ€™t have MySQL running, you can use Docker to run it:

```bash
docker run --name mysql-container -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_DATABASE=mydb -p 3306:3306 -d mysql:laster
```

This will start a MySQL instance accessible at localhost:3306 with the username root and password root.
### 4. Set Up Prisma
To use Prisma, follow these steps:
Install Prisma CLI and Prisma Client:
```bash
npm install prisma @prisma/client
```
Create the prisma folder and add the schema.prisma file.
Generate Prisma Client:
```bash
npx prisma generate
```
If you have made changes to the database schema, run migration:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### 5. Run the Microservices
Now, you are ready to run each service in development mode. To start the services, run:
```bash
npm run start:dev
```
Repeat this for each microservice (API Gateway, reader-mgt, and article-mgt).

API Endpoints
```http
POST /api/save-reader        # Save a new reader
GET  /api/get-all-readers    # Retrieve all readers
POST /api/save-article       # Save a new article
GET  /api/get-all-articles   # Retrieve all articles
POST /api/delete-article     # Delete an article by ID
```
